Based on the provided file structure and the connections between the apps in the trading pipeline, let's review the import paths in each script to ensure they are set up correctly:


market_data.py:

The market_data.py script does not have any imports related to other components in the file structure. This script is self-contained and does not directly import from other app modules, so the imports are set up correctly.



forecaster.py:

The forecaster.py script imports the fetch_intraday_data function from the market_data module. In the given file structure, the correct import path should be from market_data.market_data import fetch_intraday_data assuming the market_data.py is located in the market_data directory.



optimizer.py:

The optimizer.py script imports the arima_analysis function from the forecaster module. The correct import path should be from forecaster.forecaster import arima_analysis based on the file structure where the forecaster.py file is located in the forecaster directory.



web_app.py:

The web_app.py script does not have any imports related to other components in the file structure. This script serves as the standalone Flask web application and does not directly import from other app modules, so the imports are set up correctly.



Based on the given file structure and the connections between the apps, the import paths should be updated as indicated above to ensure that the scripts can import functions and modules from other components correctly. Update the import paths in the scripts to reflect the directory structure and connections between the components in the trading pipeline.
